    <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri'; text-align:center">What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? 
    </h2>
<p>IT has been a part of my life for a long time. My father is a web developer and always encouraged us to explore IT. Computer games where a big part of this interest when I was younger, although I was also interested in AV. </p>
    
<p>After High School I chose to peruse a creative path and studied a Bachelor of Creative Industries with a Major in film and video. Film and video has IT worked all around it. From building PC’s capable of 4k editing, running multi-terabyte shared network drives, to managing multi camera live streams IT was everywhere.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="assets/Fav.jpg" alt="Fav"></p>

<p>Part way through my degree I was offered a creative roll at a unique K-12 school. They took me on full time, which put a pause on my studies. In 2019 the school lost their IT Coordinator and offered the roll to me. It was a steep learning curve, but I was offered support and understanding and am now comfortable in my roll. </p>
  
  <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri'; text-align:center">Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 
  </h2>
<p>In mid 2021 I started hearing an Ad for TAFE and began to think about my future career. I have enjoyed my time at the school and have done a respectable job in my roll, but if I wanted to support their growth into the future or grow professionally, I needed a formal education.</p>
 
<p>Because of my employment I am not able to study full time so began my search looking at Part time local Tafe courses. Early on in my search I reached out to Open Universities and they suggested I start looking at studying a bachelor instead of a Cert 3 or 4. After my own research I took my advisors advice and moved my search to Bachelors.  </p>

<p>RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology (RMIT University, 2021) offered a good base understanding of basic concepts and 3 of the 7 Major streams appealed to me. These do not apply to the Open Universities enrollment (Open Universities, 2021), but may be able to be worked in. Also, the flexibility in study and 2 Units per period model appealed to me, so I went with RMIT.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri'; text-align:center">What do you expect to learn during your studies? 
  </h2>
<p>The Bachelor of IT at RMIT offers a great base giving and understanding of core IT concepts in the Foundation units and the Level 1 Core Subjects. As I have come into an IT roll with no training, I have some of these, but am lacking others and am hoping to gain these.</p>

<p>Further in the degree structure I am looking forward to Security and AI focused units.</p>
