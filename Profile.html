   <h3>What do the results of my test mean for me?</h3>
  <p>When I complete the 16 personalities test I was given the Logistician Personality. Reading the documentation (16Personalities, 2021) I found this description fitting and 
    could relate to many of the strengths/weaknesses and situations provided. I could immediately link the three defining characteristics of Integrity, Practical Logic, and Tireless
     dedication, to specific examples in my life all within the last 6 months. </p>
  <p>For me it was good to see the strengths and weaknesses clearly outline with examples. The strengths of Responsible, Calm and Jack of all Trades are all qualities I would now 
    describe myself as after reading the descriptions and applying it to my personal context. For weaknesses it was good to read them and apply them. Stubborn, is something that 
    those close to me have pointed out and I will move forward with this in mind considering the quote, “Accept change with grace rather than to develop reputations of being enemies 
    of new ideas”. The other weakness that really stood out was that Logisticians can unreasonably blame themselves for negative outcomes. I have done this professionally in the past 
    and will reflect on this article at the next negative outcome. </p>
  <p>I also found the “Insight of the Day” fact on the site, “Logisticians are the least likely personality to enjoy being approached by shop assistants while browsing”, very accurate. </p>

  <h3>How do you think the results may influence my behaviour in a team and how should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  <p>The description on 16Personalities highlights that individuals with the Logistician personality type often prefer to work alone and prefer autonomy and self-sufficiency over 
    reliance on someone. This could negatively affect team work depending on how our group chooses to approach the task. If we go in with 100% collaboration this could cause 
    conflict. Instead, I would prefer, roles and responsibilities be divided and spread appropriately across the team with the initial ideation process being approached 
    collaboratively, but then project work to be completed individually with regular check ins. </p>
  <p>16 Personalities also point out that the Logistician personality type are Dutiful, working hard and staying focused. “Logisticians would rather run themselves into the ground 
    with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver”. This is a beneficial trait in a team environment can be taken advantage of if other Team members shift their responsibilities
     over to me. Again, this should be resolved if we start our project with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. </p>
  <p>As mentioned, I will keep the weaknesses highlighted by 16Personalities in mind when approaching communication with my team, avoiding a stubborn mindset, insensitive and 
    overly judgmental communication. Similarly, I will try to be open to criticism and avoid taking it personally. This can be achieved by embracing a mutual respect 
    (Mind Tools Connect Team, 2021) approach to communication. </p>
  <p>Lastly an awareness of others personality types and reading up on the “Workplace habits” section on 16Personalites could be helpful in understanding another person's reasoning, 
    habit or behavior. Although this should be taken with a grain of salt, as four letters don’t do justice to an individual's identity (Grant, 2013). </p>


    <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri'; text-align:center">Online Learning Style Test</h2>
    <h3>What do the results of my test mean for me?</h3>
   <p>Learning styles is a concept that I was introduced to in high school and has further been reinforced in later studies and in my current role. The concept is that different 
     modes of instruction are effective for different individuals (Pashler, McDaniel, Rohrer and Bjork, 2008). The 4 learning styles that are most commonly discussed are Visual where
      students learn best from pictures and graphs, Aural where student learn best from listening and speaking, Reading and Writing where students learn best from Reading and Writing
       and Kinestetic where students learn best from doing something with learning materials (Klement, 2014).</p>
   <p>I took two different learning style tests and scored 12 in Kinesthetic, 8 in visual, 4 in Aural and 1 in Reading/writing through the VARK Questionnaire version 8.01 
     (VARK Learning Style Questionnaire, 2021) and was identified as a Tactile/kinesthetic learner by How-to-study.com (How-To-Study.com, 2021), which confirmed what I knew about my 
     personal learning style. This is the most common learning style representing, in some studies, up to 50.8% of respondents (Klement, 2014). </p>
   <p>As stated in the definition this means that for me I find it easier to learn through doing. This can be difficult in online study and IT in general, but one way to achieve 
     this is to watch a demonstration and then replicate them. I also found, and this was reinforced through VARK, that learning through trial and error and embracing the practice, 
     practice, practice Montra, can be beneficial. Other tips included taking regular physical breaks, actively touching, and typing with the keyboard while studying and reading real
      work case examples, all of which I already try to do. </p>
 
   <h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
   <p>In a team environment I have noticed that during lengthy project meeting updates or when reading large emails I struggle to concentrate and will often unintentionally skip 
     sections and miss important information. This can be detrimental to team work and frustrating for others who have communicated the information. I have employed strategies, 
     such as excessive note taking, to remain engaged and to help digest the content being discussed. I then use these notes to create action items which I cross off when 
     complete. </p>
   <p>I have also found that when provided exclusively written instructions for software or a task I will need to attempt it multiple times, before being comfortable with the 
     process or even successfully completing the process. This can at times be frustrating for other team members. </p>

    <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
   <p>Because I am currently working in an education environment, I regularly prepare content for classes that cover all four learning areas to help engage all learners. This 
     will usually look like a presentation of the content through PowerPoint and verbal communication accompanied by a hand out. I will then do a demonstration of the content and 
     finish with a discussion which will involve asking questions to the audience as well as taking them. I will continue to use this structure when preparing to deliver project 
     update or share a new skill set with my project members. </p>
   <p>I will also be open with my preferred learning style and ask for a demonstration where possible to better enhance my understanding. </p>


   <h2 style="font-family: 'Calibri'; text-align:center">Workplace Values Test</h2>
   <h3>What do the results of my test mean for me?</h3>
  <p>I took the Workplace Values test by 123tests.com (Work values test , 2021). They claim that scientific research shows that there are 14 work values that can be considered 
    fundamental and that if your workplace aligns with your values that you will increase the chance that you will be happy and successful in your work. I wasn’t able to find an 
    article that supported this, but found the results interesting and worth discussing. </p>
  <p>The test collects your responses rating 140 statements from “totally unimportant” to “extremely important” and scores you on a scale compared to the average. The 14 Values the 
    report scores you on are Autonomy, Creativity, Variety, Self-Development, Structure, Security, Influence, Prestige, Performance, Financial Reward, Work-life Balance, Working 
    Conditions, Work Relationships and Altruism. </p>
  <p>Overall, my results ranged from just below average to just above average with only three being out of this range. They were work life balance which was well below average, 
    financial reward which was below average and Structure which was above average. </p>
  <p>Interestingly I find that the two biggest outliers, WorkLife balance and Structure, reflect what you would expect to see based on my Myer-Briggs personality test which 
    described me as a Logistician personality type. </p>
  <p>If I try and construct a similar profile for my current workplace and compare it to my results, they score higher on the value of Creativity, Self-Development, Work 
    Relationships and Altruism and lower on Structure and Security. For the other 8 Values there isn’t meaningful change. </p>

  <h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
  <p>As my personal values profile mostly lined up with the average work values for most individuals, I should be able to work well in a team. I do need to be aware of my two 
    outlier results and consider strategies for how to best address these without impacting the dynamic and productivity of our team. </p>

   <h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
  <p>Due to the similarities, I see in the results from this Test to the Myer-Briggs test I draw a lot of the same conclusions for how to best manage these in a team situation. </p>
  <p>Structure and clearly defined roles and responsibilities is something I am going to strongly encourage our group invests time and energy into. This will help reinforce my 
    value of Structure and will also help with my Logistician personality type. Creating this structure also helps reinforce the Work Values of Autonomy and Self Development. </p>
  <p>I will need to manage my well below average value of Work-life Balance to ensure that I am not applying the same expectations on other team members. Again, the development 
    of a clear structure and responsibilities within the team should assist with this. </p>
