    <h1 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'; text-align:center">Overview</h1>
<p>Pursuit of Hoppiness is a community sourced bar rating and review app that can be used to filter by specific categories to allow beer enthusiasts to broaden their beer horizons, 
  beer bargain hunters to find and deal, and all beer lovers to come together in one place. It is the “Pursuit of Hoppiness”.</p>
<p>The app focus on reviews of venues and encourages exploration of a user's local area or can serve as a guide when you arrive somewhere new providing 5 different beer focused 
  categories to filter by instead of a single unrelated 5-star review.</p>
   
  <h1 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'; text-align:center">Motivation</h1>
<p>Beer is the most consumed alcoholic beverage in the world and third most popular beverage after water and tea (Salanță et al., 2020). Despite an overall drop in Australian beer 
  consumption the craft beer industry has grown 4.7% annually between 2016 and 2021 with a 6.2% expected growth to occur in 2021 (IBIS World, 2021). Despite this when I explore new 
  bars I find the same 4 lager taps installed. “Pursuit of Hoppiness” solves this by quickly sorting all nearby venues based on Tap Uniqueness, Total Taps, Pint Price, and Atmosphere 
  based on fellow beer enthusiast's input. The app also allows reviews and social networking with friends.</p>

  <h1 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'; text-align:center">Description</h1>

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'">UI</h2>
<p>The app will feature a similar UI to Google maps, opening on a map centered on the user's location. There will be search and filter features located at the top of the page 
  and additional page tabs located at the bottom, linking to Explore, User Profile and Friends.</p>
<p>On the map local bars will have a pin added with 5 numbers indicating the 5 rating categories giving a quick summary. Users can click on any of the venues on the map to be 
  provided with more information about the venue including street address, opening hours, links to the venues socials, user reviews and the ability to Rate.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'">Filtering</h2>
<p>Users will have the ability to filter all bars by either 5 of the categories, Tap Uniqueness, Total Taps, Pint Price, Atmosphere, Overall Rating, and distance with the sorted 
  results displaying on a list. Results on the list will filter with the best match at the top and will show the title of the venue, distance, and each categories score. Clicking 
  on a result will provide more detail on the bar including street address, opening hours, links to the venues socials, user reviews and the ability to Rate.</p>

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'">Ratings</h2>
<p>From the maps page users can select a bar and click Rate to input their ratings and a review. The ratings interface will present as a slider with words describing what either 
  end represents. The data recorded from the slider will be 0-10 which will then be averaged across all ratings and used when filtering for other users.</p>
<p>The rating input uses words instead of numbers to keep the app light an approachable after a few. The language is also intentional at polar ends of the options to inspire debate 
  amongst a table. Descriptions of the categories and the words used on either end of the scan are listed below.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="assets/Scale.png" alt="Tap Uniqueness"></p>

  <p style= "text-align:center">Tap Uniqueness- Refers to variety of the beers available on tap.<br>
    Seen in 1000 times – Totally out there</p>

  <p style= "text-align:center">Total Taps- Refers to the total number of taps in a venue<br>
    0 – 20+</p>

  <p style= "text-align:center">Pint Price- Refers to the price of the pint<br>
    Bargain – Rip Off</p>

  <p style= "text-align:center">Atmosphere- Refers to the “Vibe” of it<br>
    Family Picnic – Don't bring your mum</p>

  <p style= "text-align:center">Overall Rating- Is the rating that the user giver the venue<br>
    Never again – My new regular</p>

  <h2 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'">Reviews</h2>
<p>As well as Ratings, users will be able to leave reviews. These will be visible if a user clicks on the bar.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'">User Profiles</h2>
<p>As the service relies on user input for accurate and relevant results, we need to encourage users to contribute ratings and reviews. To do this we will gamify the process awarding 
  Badges and status levels to users based on their input. This will function similar to Google Local guides (Overview - Local Guides Help, 2021). The badges will be publicly visible 
  next to user reviews on profile images.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="assets/Profile.png" alt="Profile Picture"></p>
<p>The Profiles will also have networking features with the ability to add other users as friends and see their ratings and reviews in an activity feed. This will encourage organic 
  growth in existing social networking groups.

<h1 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'; text-align:center">Tools, Technologies and Skills Required</h1>
<p>The app will be software and UI heavy with minimal need for any hardware skills.</p>
<p>I do not have experience with app creation, but assume that achieving the primary function of listing bars based on location and further filtering the results based on the 5 
  categories should be reasonable to achieve. I had a quick look at MIT App maker, Power BI and Appsheet and think a working sample could be made on either of these platforms, with 
  low to no code.</p>  
<p>Similarly creating a form for users to input their ratings and comments should be straight forward with the information being collected and stored on a cloud-based database 
  service such as AWS, Azure or GCP (Yehuda, 2020). We can also use open-source Database solution, but this can introduce compatibility issues (Top 12 Open Source Database Software 
  for Your Next Project, 2021) depending how we build the app. These also require local hosting.</p>
<p>As I plan to have user profiles to identify comments, allow badges and allow social networking we need a secure way of creating user accounts and storing their credentials. 
  This is another area I do not have experience in and would lean towards another third-party provider like Ping Identity, which provide a “Frictionless Identity” 
  (Ping Identity, 2021) platform. There are also open-source Identity solutions such as OpenIAM and Apache Syncope (Canner, 2019) which can be investigated if the project is taken 
  further.</p>
<p>The last skill sets needed are fir developing the User Interface and User Experience.</p>


<h1 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT'; text-align:center">Outcome</h1>
<p>For the app to function properly it requires significant user input. I see this being the biggest initial hurdle to overcome. If it does have significant user buy in than 
  I can see the app becoming a regular part of an evening out.</p>
<p>It will help beer fans quickly identify what is near them and make an educated decision about where to go next based on our 5 categories rather than 1 first star rating.</p>  
<p>It will also help further the Craft Beer culture and support local businesses with users choosing to explore their local area and embrace Totally out their Taps rather than 
  always heading back to the one watering hole.</p>
